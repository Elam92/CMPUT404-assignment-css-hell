		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>
			<img src="Me.jpg"></img>
			Hi, my name is Eric Lam. I will be graduating this year with a Bachelor's Degree in Computing Science and a Certificate in Game Design. My main interests are in Game Development, but also in general Software Development. As a kid, I have always wondered what I should be when I grow up. I thought to myself back then: "I always sit on the computer anyway, maybe I should get a career related to that!" And so here I am graduating as a Computer Programmer. I love to program, it feels great when you create a working piece of software that can serve a purpose.
		</p>
		<br/>

		<h1>My History</h1>
		<p>
			My programming experience is mainly from taking university courses. In CMPUT 301, my team developed a Java-based Diary program, utilizing requirements analysis and incremental prototyping. In CMPUT 401 - Software Process and Product Management, my team and I developed a working website for the university's Minerva Deaf Research Lab for data gathering purposes. We performed requirements analysis, project planning, evolutionary prototyping, and meetings with the clients during this course. From January 2013 to present, I was hired by the Research Lab to continue on the development of the website and the development of an ASL-related game/app.
		</p>
		<p>
			In another course, CMPUT 250 - Computers and Games, my game was nominated in Audio, Technical, and Game of the Year Achievements.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since summer 2013, I have been learning the Unity Engine in order to develop games as either a hobby or as a career. I have participated in the 2014 Global Game Jam, creating a short game called "Enclosure" with a team of 4. I am currently in a game course developing another game made in the Unity Engine called "Newton's Law" that will be completed in the end of April 2014.
		</p>

		<h1>What I Can Do</h1>

		<p>
			I can create games utilizing the Unity Engine, develop websites utilizing HTML5 and Javascript, and develop software in either C++ or Java.
