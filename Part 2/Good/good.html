		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>
			<img src="Me.jpg"></img>
			Hi, my name is Eric Lam. I will be graduating this year with a Bachelor's Degree in Computing Science and a Certificate in Game Design. My main interests are in Game Development, but also in general Software Development. As a kid, I have always wondered what I should be when I grow up. I thought to myself back then: "I always sit on the computer anyway, maybe I should get a career related to that!" And so here I am graduating as a Computer Programmer. I love to program, it feels great when you create a working piece of software that can serve a purpose.
		</p>

		<h1>My History</h1>
		<p>
			In a computer course, CMPUT 401 

			Since summer 2013, I have been learning the Unity Engine in order to develop games as either a hobby or as a career. I have participated in the 2014 Global Game Jam, creating a short game called "Enclosure" with a team of 4. I am currently in a game course developing another game made in the Unity Engine called "Newton's Law" that will be completed in the end of April 2014.
		</p>

		<h1>What I Can Do</h1>

		<p>
			I can create games utilizing the Unity Engine, develop websites utilizing HTML5 and Javascript, and develop software in either C++ or Java.
